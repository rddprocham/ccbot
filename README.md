# CCBot

This is a discord bot for a french server called La Terre Promise (LTP). I'm releasing the source code to show the progress, feel free to open issues/PRs if you want nonetheless.



## Environment Variables

To run this bot on your machine, you'll need to create a ```.env``` file based on the structure of ```.env.example```. It should be pretty self-explanatory.

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, the bot was only made to be used in LTP, and not filling **all** the ```.env``` fields might make the script crash, even if you don't want to use all the functions in it.
